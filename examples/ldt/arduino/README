The files contained in this folder exemplify the use of muaompc 
in the Arduino microcontroller. 
To generate MPC code that can be compiled and run directly on an Arduino
follow the next steps:

1. generate the MPC C-code by run the main.py script
2. on the Arduino IDE, open the sketch muaompc_arduino/muaompc_arduino.ino
3. modify the sketch to suit your needs

The first time the code is generated, the file sketch 
muaompc_arduino/muaompc_arduino.ino 
will be a copy a the file tmpl_muaompc_arduino.ino. 
If an sketch already exist in subsequent code generations, 
the file muaompc_arduino/muaompc_arduino.ino will not
be replaced.
