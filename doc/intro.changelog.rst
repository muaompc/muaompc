Known issues 
------------
  
As an early alpha release, 
there are several things that are stil fragile, namely:
     
* Version 1.0.0-alpha

   - The parsing capabilities are very limited. 
     Only the most common cases are at the moment supported (see the examples)

   - The Python interface to the generated code is still not nearly as polished
     as the MATLAB interface.

   - The SIMULINK interface is still missing.
